# hello-world
My first repository
Writing something about myself as instructed in the GitHub Guide.

**Thoughts on this after so many years**

- "Wow... this brings back sweet memories (imagine 9 years)! I checked out the content of this repo and got bewildered as to what on earth is "Chilli Corn Hub"! 😆 The past version of myself just made me laugh when I eventually saw what it is (some random content just for purposes of practicing markdown). When I first came up with this repo, I so wanted to become a data scientist. Now that I am a data science consultant, I want to learn Wing Chun! 😄 I will get back to reading this after 3 years."
